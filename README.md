# 11th Montreal Industrial Problem Solving Workshop (IPSW)
During this weeklong event, university researchers work in teams to solve real business problems proposed by participating companies. The IPSW is seen as an "incubator" of collaboration between industrial and academic participants (link to the event: http://crm.umontreal.ca/probindustrielsEn2021/).

## The problem
The TD Assets Management representatives were interested in devising a methodology to: 1. predict assets' risk level using factorial and statistical methods; 2. build portofolios with minimal volatility (long only, without leverage). First, we created an interactive dashboard tool using Plotly Dash to explore return over time and interactions between factors. Then, we proposed a solution in two parts using: 1. gradient boosting machines (classical machine learning), and 2. conditional autoencoders (deep learning).

## My experience at IPSW
It was very stimulating to collaborate on a real-world problem with a team of professors, post-doc, and Ph.D. It was challenging to to solve this business problem with the time constraints. I was designated **Team MVP** by our coordinators for my active involvment in the project planning, team coordination, and slide deck creation.
